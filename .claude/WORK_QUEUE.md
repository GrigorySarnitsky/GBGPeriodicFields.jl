# Session work queue

One line per committed item. `- [ ]` open, `- [x]` done. `.claude/hooks/queue-guard.sh` is a Stop
hook that refuses to let the session end while any item is open, so "am I finished?" is answered by
a program rather than by my judgement — which this session measured as unreliable in exactly the
flattering direction.

Close an item ONLY when it is done and verified. An item closed to end the turn is the defect the
hook exists to prevent. A genuinely blocked item is closed with the blocker written on the line, so
the block shows in the diff instead of being silent.

## Open (authorised 2026-08-27: "continue with everything, don't stop in the middle")

- [x] Exhaustive survey: RUN (66 min), analysed — 0 correctness findings; its one real finding (576 type-stability cells, all `reality_residual` inferring `Any`) is FIXED
- [x] Benchmarks: transfer + convolution re-swept on CPU t1, CPU t4 and GPU 5070TI, idle machine
      comparison per axis per point, so the transfer class genuinely moved)
- [x] RESULTS.md: regenerated over the correct ten archives, merge verified both directions, analysed as finding (ab)
      systematic movement before naming a cause
- [x] CLAUDE.md: survey figures replaced with the 2026-08-28 run's measured numbers
- [x] Commit and push everything, including this harness

## Open (authorised 2026-08-28: "find out the reason for all of the slowdowns. And I mean all")

- [x] CPU t1: five 512³ convolution rows, x1.16–1.35 — isolate CODE from ENVIRONMENT by measuring the
      baseline commit in the same sweep shape
- [x] CPU t4: five 128³/256³ rows (convolve! scalar, ∘radial, and three spline interpolate rows), same method
- [x] GPU 5070TI: ten small-grid transfer rows, x1.13–1.49, same method against its own baseline commit
- [x] Attribute each cluster to a named cause, or state precisely what was excluded and what remains
- [x] Record the findings and commit
